          * Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
        </div>
        <div class="text-lg text-justify">
          One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and
          const, which can be used for variable declaration. The question is,
          what makes them different from good ol' var which we've been using? If
          you are still not clear about this, then this article is for you. In
          this article, we'll discuss var, let and const with respect to their
          scope, use, and hoisting. As you read, take note of the differences
          between them that I'll point out. <br /><br />
          Variables declared with var can have a global or local scope. Global
          scope is for variables declared outside functions, while local scope
          is for variables declared inside functions.Variables declared with var
          can be redeclared and reassigned.Variables declared with var are
          hoisted to the top of their global or local scope, which makes them
          accessible before the line they are declared. <br /><br />
          Variables declared with let can have a global, local, or block scope.
          Block scope is for variables declared in a block. A block in
          JavaScript involves opening and closing curly braces.Just like var,
          variables declared with let can be reassigned to other values, but
          they cannot be redeclared.Variables declared with let are hoisted to
          the top of their global, local, or block scope, but their hoisting is
          a little different from the one with var. var variables are hoisted
          with a default value of undefined, which makes them accessible before
          their line of declaration (as we've seen above). But, let variables
          are hoisted without a default initialization. So when you try to
          access such variables, instead of getting undefined, or variable is
          not defined error, you get cannot access variable before
          initialization. <br /><br />
          Variables declared with const are similar to let in regards to scope.
          Such variables can have a global, local, or block scope.const is
          different from var and let. const is used for declaring constant
          variables which are variables with values that cannot be changed. So
          such variables cannot be redeclared, and neither can they be
          reassigned to other values.Variables declared with const, just like
          let, are hoisted to the top of their global, local, or block scope but
          without a default initialization.

          * Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
        </div>
        <div class="text-lg text-justify">
          Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type
          in JavaScript. The variable which has been assigned as null contains
          no value. Undefined, on the other hand, means the variable has been
          declared, but its value has not been assigned.The typeof() operator
          returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned
          as null and for undefined value the typeof() operator returns
          undefined.

          * What do you mean by REST API?
        </div>
        <div class="text-lg text-justify">
          An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that
          define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with
          each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design
          principles of the REST, or representational state transfer
          architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred
          to RESTful APIs. <br /><br />
          First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his
          doctoral dissertation, REST provides a relatively high level of
          flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is just one
          reason why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting
          components and applications in a microservices architecture.
